# ðŸš¨ RENDER DASHBOARD FIX - Step by Step

## The Problem
Your deployment logs show the old password `CBdglAXg0FlYKVvd` instead of the new password `H542CdNlCqnDwoE8`. This means the environment variable in Render dashboard was never updated.

## SOLUTION: Update Environment Variables in Render Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Render Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Log in to your account
3. You should see your services listed

### Step 2: Select Your Backend Service
1. Look for your backend service (likely named something like "notebinsbackend" or similar)
2. Click on the service name to open it

### Step 3: Navigate to Environment Settings
1. In the left sidebar, click **"Environment"**
2. You'll see a list of environment variables

### Step 4: Update MONGODB_URI
1. Find the row with **"MONGODB_URI"** in the Key column
2. Click the **"Edit"** button (pencil icon) next to it
3. In the Value field, replace the entire URI with:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://fahadpatwary:H542CdNlCqnDwoE8@savednote.iji1p.mongodb.net/notebins?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=SavedNote
   ```
4. Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

### Step 5: Save and Deploy
1. Click **"Save Changes"**
2. In the dropdown that appears, select **"Save, rebuild, and deploy"**
3. Click **"Save"** to confirm

### Step 6: Monitor the Deployment
1. Render will start a new deployment automatically
2. Click on the **"Logs"** tab to watch the deployment progress
3. Look for the message: "MongoDB connected successfully"
4. The deployment should complete without the authentication error

## If You Can't Find the Environment Variable
If MONGODB_URI doesn't exist in the Environment tab:
1. Click **"+ Add Environment Variable"**
2. Set Key: `MONGODB_URI`
3. Set Value: `mongodb+srv://fahadpatwary:H542CdNlCqnDwoE8@savednote.iji1p.mongodb.net/notebins?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=SavedNote`
4. Click **"Save Changes"** and select **"Save, rebuild, and deploy"**

## Expected Result
After following these steps:
- The deployment logs should show the new password `H542CdNlCqnDwoE8`
- MongoDB connection should succeed
- The "bad auth: authentication failed" error should disappear
- Your frontend should be able to connect to the backend
